# Let *There* Be Light: Finding Meaning at the Edge of Physics

> “Let there be light.”  
>  *Genesis 1:3*

It's one of the most famous sentences in human history.  
But what if we've been missing the most powerful word in it?

Not *light*.  
Not *let*.  
But: **there**.

## The Secret Inside a Simple Word

"Let *there* be light."

What does “there” mean in a universe that hasn't been formed yet?

“There” implies a *place*  a location, a direction, a clearing in the chaos. Before light can illuminate, it needs somewhere to shine. Before anything can appear, there must be *a field of appearance*.

This isn't just biblical poetics. It's metaphysics. It's geometry. It might even be physics.

## Penrose, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, and the Edge That Isn't

In Roger Penrose’s model of the universe **Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC)** the universe doesn’t begin with a bang from nothing. Instead, it ends with the fading of everything.

- All mass decays.
- Only light and gravitational waves remain.
- The universe becomes flat, timeless, scaleless — pure radiation.

Then Penrose does something wild: he takes this infinite, empty future and **resizes it** using *conformal geometry*, compressing it into the next Big Bang.

> The **end** of one universe becomes the **beginning** of the next.  
> The Alpha is the Omega — not metaphorically, but mathematically.

But what passes through this cosmic veil?  
**Photons. Ripples. Memory.**

## A Place for Light to Go

Now, return to Genesis:

> “Let *there* be light.”

What if that ripple that gravitational whisper from the dying universe — is **God’s voice**?

Not in a supernatural sense, but in a **structural** one.

The ripple says:
- “Here is where light will move.”
- “This is the structure.”
- “Let there be a *there*.”

It isn’t just about making light exist. It’s about **assigning it a domain**. A direction. A purpose.

## Geist and the Field of Meaning

In philosophical terms, this is **Geist unfolding** — the self-revealing structure of Spirit.

Before appearance, there must be the **possibility** of appearance.

"Let there be light" is the moment Geist opens a space for Being to happen.

It's not just about matter or motion. It’s about **intelligibility**. The universe doesn’t just *exist* it *makes sense*. And it begins by saying where that sense should start.

## So... Are We Just Projecting?

A fair question.

Is this all just a game of interpreting old texts to fit modern science?

Maybe.

But maybe that’s what thinking *is* seeing echoes, following patterns, letting myth and math speak to each other.

> “Even if it’s all BS... it’ll make you think.”

And if thinking is how Geist unfolds — then maybe that's enough.

## One Last Thought

He didn’t just create light.

**He told it where to go.**

What if that’s what we’re still listening for?
